# Hourly-Indian-Air-Quality-Analysis-and-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning-Techniques

An analysis and prediction of air quality using machine learning and deep learning techniques would involve several steps. First, a dataset would need to be collected that includes hourly measurements of various pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM2.5). This data would then be preprocessed and cleaned to remove any missing or invalid values.

Next, various machine learning and deep learning models would be trained on the dataset to predict the levels of pollutants at a given hour based on the input features. The model used for time series forecasting is LSTM. 

LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory. It is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is commonly used for sequential data analysis, such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

The model is then trained and tested on the dataset to evaluate their performance.

Once the model is done, it can be used to predict the air quality for future hour. The prediction can be used by government and private organization to take necessary actions to mitigate the air pollution.

It's important to note that this is a simplified overview of the process and that there are many nuances and considerations that would need to be taken into account when conducting a real-world analysis and prediction of air quality using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
